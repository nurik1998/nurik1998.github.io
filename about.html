       <h2>In college, I was involved with the organizing of various community outreach programs and charitable institutions. To add to this,I'm really interest in programming and create website, an organization that engages college students in mentoring high school students from the community. In my three years with the organization our group mentored over 80 students, 80% of these students have matriculated to a three-year university.
In my spare time, I love taking pictures. I have even documented many university events as part of my artistic practice. Working hand in hand with others has surely stood out to me as a passion in my life. I enjoy collaborating with others, artistically through photography and most certainly, through mentorship. I look forward to continuing to develop these skills and passions through this opportunity.</h3>
